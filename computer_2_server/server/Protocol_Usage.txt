Usage:
        enc <message>                           Will tell the server to encrypt the message (using his public key)
                                                and send back the corresponding ciphertext.
                                                The result format will be: <number of bytes>\0<ciphertext bytes>
                                                In case of an error:
                                                        ERROR_1 Space must separate between "enc" and the message.
                                                        ERROR_2 Message can't be of length 0.
                                                        ERROR_3 Server side error, will shutdown the server.

        dec <number of bytes>\0<ciphertext>     Will tell the server to decrypt the ciphertext (using his private key)
                                                and send back "DONE" once he is finished.
                                                Note: he will not send back the decrypted message or info about it failing.
                                                In case of an error:
                                                        ERROR_1 Space must separate between "dec" and the ciphertext.
                                                        ERROR_2 Ciphertext size must be positive integer.
                                                        ERROR_3 Server side error, will shutdown the server.

        genkey                                  Will tell the server to delete his current private/public key pair and create new set.
                                                Will send back "DONE" once he is finished.
                                                In case of an error, will return "ERROR" and shutdown.

        pubinfo                                 Will ask the server to return the modulus and exponent of the public key.
                                                The result format will be:
                                                        <exponent number of bytes>\0<exponent in hex without 0x prefix>\0<modulus number of bytes>\0<modulus in dec>
                                                In case of an error, will return "ERROR" and shutdown.

        exit                                    Disconnect the client.

        shutdown                                Disconnect the client and shutdown the server.
